if it shows that “ connection refused“ or ”operation time out”,input" ssh root@104.225.235.42  -p  28162 " ;   
if it shows that "warning:remote host identification has changed “ you need to open "finder"，click "command +shift +G”;
input “user/xhb/.ssh/known_hosts  “  and find the line involve "104.225.235.42 "，delete “ ssh -rsa”.
